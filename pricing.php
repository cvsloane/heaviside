  					<h3 class="white">Hey It’s Chris from Heaviside Group</h3>
  					<p>
  						Thanks for requesting information about our pricing. 
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						At Heaviside Group, we have one mission for every customer: deliver a steady stream of profitable new customers. Every project and service we offer are designed to do exactly this. I would be glad to provide a complete proposal and exact quote after we talk about your needs, but here’s some basic pricing information.
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						A website for a small or medium-sized business that is custom designed, strategically built to turn visitors into customers, and optimized for
smartphones usually costs between $3k and $6k. 85-90% of small business websites should fall into this range. A large website that involves hundreds of pages or very advanced custom features usually costs between $10k and $25k. Examples might be sites doing e-commerce, sites that handle employee-related tasks like timekeeping, in-depth customer-facing quoting pages, etc. If you’ve seen quotes in this high range for a website and you don’t have these kinds of advanced requirements, chances are you are really being charged to support a bloated agency staff.
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						Whatever kind of site you need, it will come with The Heaviside You’ll Love It or Else! Guarantee. You’ll 100% love the result or else we’ll 100% redo it/refund you.
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						Our online marketing services can cost anywhere from $199/month to $2,999/month, and can include the following:
  					</p>
  					<p class=" margin-fifty">
  						 <span class="highlight"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Managed Web Hosting, Email, Maintenance, and Security</span><br>
includes web and email hosting, as well as site maintenance and security
  					</p>
  					<p class=" margin-fifty">
  						 <span class="highlight"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Managed Local Business Website</span><br>
flat rate includes website updates, local SEO, analytics setup and reports, social media integration, and online reviews management
  					</p>
  					<p class=" margin-fifty">
  						 <span class="highlight"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Managed Email Marketing Services</span><br>
email is still the highest ROI marketing approach, by far. We’ll help you set it up and manage it
  					</p>
  					<p class=" margin-fifty">
  						 <span class="highlight"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Managed Social Media Services</span><br>
unique daily content for your business delivered directly to Facebook and Twitter
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						We call them all managed for a reason–we get you out of the website and internet marketing business and take accountability for results. Whatever combination you choose, it will come with The Heaviside Results Matter… Or It’s Free! Guarantee. If you’re not seeing the results you want in 90 days we’ll work up to another 90 days for free to make sure you are. And if you’re still not satisfied? You can walk away because we don’t make you sign service contracts.
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						Many agencies with bloated staffs do exactly that. We don’t have to. We know what clients are a best-fit for us, what services will make the biggest impact for them, and how to deliver them efficiently and profitably. If you are looking for rebranding, “traditional” advertising management, or print/show work, we are not who you are looking for.
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						But if you’re a small- to medium-size business owner that primarily serves a local customer base and you don’t have the time or expertise to do this, we are built to help you grow.
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						If you have questions or would like more information, please give us a call at (262) 373-8252 or visit our website to request a free quote and consultation.
 
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						Thanks! Have a great day!
  					</p>
