    			Most of your prospects are searching for you on the internet, and more of them will find you if your search engine optimization is good. There are numerous factors that combine to increase your search result rankings, and you need a solid, strategic approach based on best practices to succeed.

    			<h2>On-Page SEO</h2>
    			<p>
    				This is primarily focused on technical factors that search engines “look for” when crawling and indexing pages. This is a complex discipline with many different things to be aware of, and should really be done properly when your website is built or redone. On-Page SEO is extremely important to land in competitive spots on results pages. It’s also a danger area, where poor or black-hat work can wipe you off the map.

    		</div>
    		<div class="col">
    			<h2>Off-Site SEO</h2>
    			<p>
    				This is primarily focused on links back to your website from other sites. There are many ways to do this wrong, and it is very easy to get your site penalized and dropped out of the search pages. We use an approach designed by one of the best in the world, and it has been proven to work again and again. It’s also an approach that Google will never penalize. Be very careful who partner with for Off-Site SEO!

    				We recommend that you choose your search engine optimization partner carefully. Google (and others) change their ranking methods frequently, often to target “black-hat” practices by unethical SEO providers. Such providers look for methods that exploit the search algorithms and promise “easy” and “fast” results. As with anything else, a discerning consumer should be wary of such claims. Quality search engine optimization takes time, and is not cheap.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				Working with these providers exposes you to risk. While you may see a short term increase in results, the penalty when Google catches you or changes their ranking method is steep.

    				We have seen sites lose most of their traffic, and it can take over a year or more to recover from the damage.
    			</h2>
    			<p>
    				If your current provider is focused only on your traffic, that is also a clue they are not providing you value. Search engine optimization is not just about the traffic, but about the results for your business. If that is not part of your conversation and strategy, it won’t happen. What good are 10,000 new visitors per month if none of them buy anything?
