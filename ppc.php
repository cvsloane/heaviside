            Chances are you don’t build your own car, or home. Unless you’re an expert, the results would be disastrous. AdWords is no different. While Google makes it seem very easy and even offers “help” from their staff, the reality is that AdWords campaigns can rapidly become a failing money pit if not handled with care. Most companies who say “AdWords doesn’t work” have had this experience.

          <p class="justify">
            There are numerous ways to do it wrong. Fortunately, there is a very clear set of best-practices that drastically minimize your risk and allow a profitable campaign to be built safely. Don’t take the risk, hire Brookfield web design and pay per click management experts to get the job done right.

            You should not use anyone who is not a Google Certified AdWords Professional. This is one of our certs. While no certification can guarantee results, it does establish a baseline of competency that should not be ignored. You also need a partner who will use caution. Just because someone knows how to design and implement an AdWords campaign according to Google specifications does not mean they will know how to make it profitable.
